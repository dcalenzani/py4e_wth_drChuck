# Python 4 Everybody solved exercises

This repo contains all the solved exercises for the Py4e courses available in coursera. You can check more info on the course on [here](https://www.py4e.com/). I must thank Dr. Chuck as he is one of the best teachers I've seen when teaching to code, this is my personal opinion, but his pedagological approach teaches you the fundamental of not only python but the programming ecosystem as a whole. Much better than IBM or Google courses.

Might this help some lost souls in search of solution (while that soul might be myself more than others)
